### About
The Repos basic function is it to help me learn and improve my Git skills and in the future hopefully also these of my fellow student colleges ...
I´ll share my code solutions and my excercise sheets here and will complete and update this repo until the end of my 2nd semester.
Also I´ll excuse myself for any mistakes, due to the fact that this is no big project of mine, but a simple exercise which I´ll do without double checking everything.
Nevertheless i hope to help others with this, so enjoy!
