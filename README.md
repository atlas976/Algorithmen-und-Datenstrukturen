# Algorithms_and_Datastructures
This is a Repo for my Uni work in my second semester in "Algorythmen und Datenstrukturen".
Its basic function is to help me learn and improve my Git skills and in the future hopefully also these of my fellow student colleges ...
I´ll share my code and my excercise sheets here and will complete and update this repo until the end of my 2nd semester.
Also I´ll excuse myself for any mistakes, due to the fact that this is no big project of mine, but a simple exercise which I´ll do without double checking everything.
Nevertheless i hope to help others with this, so enjoy!

Quick edit: if there are any mistakes or possibilities of improvement, feel free to tell me about!

Current State of excercises & todos:

- exercise 1: completed
- exercise 2: completed
- exercise 3: completed
- exercise 4: completed
- exercise 5: not completed
